This repository contains a basic "Hello World" application, in this case a web interface that generates random numbers.

Steps to install:

* clone the repository
* execute `sudo ./install.sh`
* review the output

Steps to deploy a new version, after the first install:

* perform local changes or pull remote changes with `git pull`
* execute `sudo ./deploy.sh`
* review the output

This process has been tested on Ubuntu 24.04 and is suitable for development. Production deployment is a different story, outside the scope of this repository.
